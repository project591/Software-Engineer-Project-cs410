    Setup:

The setup requires access to an IDE of your choice(Android Studio is preferred, but can work with others). An android emulator is used as the primary device,
and what you need to do is, initialize an emulator then download the code from this repository. Use this documentation to help setup Flutter SDK and resolve 
any other issues. https://docs.flutter.dev/

    Build:

The build is simply choosing an emulator that you have set up before or a new one, then pressing play to build.

    Run:

In order to run the program you must either go on atsign.com and register and verify a name or use the logon to create one. From there you need logon into the
app and create a review and share it with another verified atsign name. If you wanted to test the functionallity on your own you would need to either have two 
emulators running or you would need to logon, make the review, logout, and login to the atsign your sharing with. `
